\chapter{Introduction\label{introduction}}

\section{General \label{introduction-General}}

Grisbi is a free accounting program, developed in the \gls{C} language with support for \gls{GTK}+ 3, originally for the \gls{GNU/Linux} platform. There is now a \indexword{\gls{porting}}\index{porting} on \gls{Windows}, \gls{macOS}, FreeBSD, packages for different  \gls{Linux distributions}, and other possibilities to discover on \lang{Grisbi}\footnote{\urlGrisbi{}} or \lang{Sourceforge}\footnote{\urlSourceForge{}}.

The basic principle is to allow you to classify in a simple and intuitive way your financial operations, whatever they are, in order to be able to exploit them in the best way according to your needs.

Grisbi emphasises simplicity and efficiency, without excluding the sophistication needed by more advanced users. Future features will always try to meet these criteria.

\section{Features\label{introduction-features}}

\strong{Translators Note:} In this translation, the French word ``Tiers'' in general has been replaced by the English word "Payees", however the French version of Grisbi also caters for small business use. In the French version any third party i.e. a creditor or debtor could be implied by the word ``Tiers''.\\
\textbf{Note:} French business accounting rules may be incompatible with the rules of any English speaking territories, Grisbi should be used \strong{only} for personal financial record keeping outside of France.

\section{Software Evolution}

\subsection{Development and versions}

Grisbi is software in active development, any feedback (idea, bug, documentation\dots{}) is welcome. You can send it to the relevant lists referenced in the  \vref{introduction-contacts} \menu{Contacts} section or on the  \lang{Grisbi}\footnote{\urlGrisbi{}} site.


%You can, if you have the taste of adventure, download the versions in development on the Grisbi content management system based on \gls{Git}.
If you're feeling adventurous, you can download and compile the latest version being under development on the content management system \gls{GitHub}\footnote{\urlGitHubGrisbi{}\label{siteGitHubGrisbi}} using \gls{Git}.

Indeed, the code of a new versions of Grisbi is typically frozen several weeks before its final release, in order to allow the development team time to check and eradicate the latest bugs. During this period, the format of the account file no longer changes, and you can, with a minimum of precautions (frequent backups, etc.), benefit from the latest improvements several weeks in advance, and also participate in debugging.

%Finally you also have access to all the evolutions of the code after version 0.3.2 (the version from which we set up a \gls{CVS} on the Grisbi site.
Finally, you can access all changes to the code since version 0.3.2 (the version from which the code is available on the \gls{GitHub}\footref{siteGitHubGrisbi} website).

Note that as of version 0.6, even numbered minor number versions (e.g. 0. \underline8) are stable versions, whereas odd number minor number versions are unstable and should not be used under normal conditions; therefore only stable versions are mentioned here.

\section{Authors and contributors\label{introduction-authors}} %TODO section to be updated/completed

Cédric \familyname{Auger} is the basis of the project.

Daniel \familyname{Cartron} wrote the documentation up to version 0.4.0, provided accounting advice and ergonomics, and created the first Grisbi site. His passion for ultra-compliant accounts files brings an undeniable bonus to the discovery of unpublished bugs.

André \familyname{Pascual}, from \lang{Linuxgraphic}\footnote{\urlLinuxGraphic{}}, is the author of the first logo (Grisbi mascot on the euro symbol €).

Sébastien \familyname{Blondeel} wrote the scripts used to produce the various documentation formats and those for converting images to the appropriate formats. He is also responsible for the adoption of \gls{LaTeX} for writing the documentation. In addition, his experience of electronic publishing makes him a valuable adviser and source of many suggestions.

Benjamin \familyname{Drieu}, developer for Grisbi and official packager for \gls{Debian}.

Alain \familyname{Portal}, who was starting to get bored in \gls{RedHat} packaging. His love of a job well done and his obstinacy make him, for the moment, a bug fixer. He also participates in the compilation of the documentation. He wants to start coding in the unstable version.

Loic \familyname{Breilloux} has updated the documentation for version 0.5.1 and will try to update the documentation for future releases.

Gerald \familyname{Niel} replaced Daniel \familyname{Cartron} in the role of webmaster and is therefore the creator of the new version of \lang{Grisbi}\footnote{\urlGrisbi{}}. He is also responsible for \gls{Slackware} packages.

Juliette \familyname{Martin} has the thankless task of proofreading of the documentation. If there are any mistakes, it's certainly they were well hidden for escaping his attentive eyes

François \familyname{Terrot}\footnote{\urlFrancoisTerrotEmail{}} joined the team to create Grisbi's \gls{porting} for Windows.

{Pierre \familyname{Biava}}\footnote{\urlPierreBiavaEmail{}} joined the development team in 2008.

Didier\familyname{Chevalier}\footnote{\urlDidierChevalierEmail{}},William \familyname{Ollivier}\footnote{\urlWilliamOllivierEmail{}} and Mickael \familyname{Remars} have also participated in development.

{Jean-Luc \familyname{Duflot}}\footnote{\urlJeanLucDuflotEmail{}} made a big update of the manual for the 0.6 version, which was needed since 2004, and continued on with the 0.8 and the 1.0 versions too.

Alain \familyname{Letient}\footnote{\urlAlainLetientEmail{}} tenaciously re-read the 0.6 manual and created its iconography, and also continued with versions 0.8 and 1.0.

Guy \familyname{Lebègue}, first for version 0.8, then with {Michèle\familyname{Bondil}}\footnote{\urlMicheleBondilEmail{}} for 1.0, created the business accounting option, which requires many specialist accounting skills.

\section{Acknowledgments \label{introduction-thanks}}

Thanks to \lang{TuxFamily}\footnote{\urlTuxFamily{}} who has long made available to us all the tools we needed to develop Grisbi 
(website, ftp, CVS, mailing lists, etc.). Alas, the attacks inflicted by hackers in late 2003 - early 2004 on \lang{TuxFamily} have forced us to seek a new web home. So today we thank \lang{SourceForge}\footnote{\urlSourceForge{}}, the platform to which we migrated.  We wish a quick and quick recovery to \lang{TuxFamily} that is sorely lacking hundreds of free projects.

A big thank you also to all the contributors on the development list who helped Grisbi's evolution through their suggestions, remarks and bug reports, as well as to the many readers of the \menu{User Manual}, which contribute to make it a better tool.

\subsection{Introduction \label{introduction-manual-presentation}}

Although Grisbi is designed to be as intuitive as possible and most functions are immediately understandable, a reference manual is needed. This manual has been designed according to the following principles:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the most comprehensive possible, covering all the program features;
	\item chapters organised according to a framework that is as standardised as possible:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[\textopenbullet] presentation of the chapter
			\item[\textopenbullet] description of the display
			\item[\textopenbullet] description of the functions
		\end{itemize}
		to help you find your way around the document	 
	\item paragraphs that recur from one chapter to the next are written in as identical a manner as possible, to make them easier to read quickly
	\item easy to find information thanks to numerous \gls{hyperlinks}, an index and a glossary.
\end{itemize}

% space for theme change: 5 mm
